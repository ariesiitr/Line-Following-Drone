# Line-Following-Drone

Problem Statement :
We need to work on designing a Minidrone line follower algorithm. Teams will need to use their modeling skills to refine a Simulink model.

In this project we work on a mindrone in MATLAB.
We used our modeling skills to refine a simulink model.

Packages Required : MATLAB, Simulink, Stateflow, Image Processing.

By using this packages we implemented our model in simulation based minidrone.

Process :
-> at first, by using image processing we converted the images captured into a grey scale image
-> then we found the edges of lines we have to follow
-> then by some pid controllers , we made the control system of the drone

further details can be seen in the project file.
